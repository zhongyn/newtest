# This file is used to include specific functions for settings
# that cannot be included within the general fabric script.
# It should include at least the following functions:
# * def app_prompt_user_for_inputs()
# * def app_set_required_environment_vars()
#
# If you don't need to use these, just return from them.
#

# New prompts can sent to the user that set environmental variables for them.
# This can be done using the following syntax:
# utility.prompt_user_for_input(some_environment_name, "What question would you like to ask the user?", default_choice=False)
# The default_choice is what is chosen if the user just hits enter when they see it. It is False by default.
