== Generic Fabric

This script is meant to be used to deploy Rails and CakePHP web apps.
It contains the common logic used by most web applications deployments
and upgrades. It also provides a module: app.py to include functions 
specific to an application.

== Usage

You must define an environment to run the fabric script.

fab to:[dev,staging,production] <command>

If you are installing an application for the first time use:
* initialize - it will create the needed directories

For future deployments just use: deploy.
